# flight-HUD
This project is a concept I've been working on for a short time now, It's to create a display to the outside of a skydiving helmet. 
Giving the users an accurate altitude reading as well as a heading back to the drop zone all from the their POV.
My first challenge is finding the right hardware which can proccess alitude and gps data and display them on and OLED screen.
